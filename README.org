* What is this repository for?
A simple repository to contain the configuration files of my editors, and settings of the IDEs as well. Maybe a bit more.

Kind of also used as a log of changes made over the years of Linux Distros and Window Manager hopping.

It really only just contains my configurations of my =.vimrc=, and maybe I'll add in my emacs config once I get the hang of it as well.

** 19/04/2021

I've converted to Arch Linux.

I've connected bunch of my files required for my configuration into this repository.
At this point, the config consists of a large number of applications, and software, ranging from fish to vim, to tmux, to qtile, to DOOM Emacs.

I can probably say that it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to get my setup back, on a new computer of Arch Linux, with a simple git pull and configure using symlinks at this point.

** 30/04/2021

Discovered [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot*getting-started][dotbot]].
My setup only continues to be easier to set up.

At this point, all I need to do in order to set myself back up, would be a simple few lines.

#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:dat-adi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
#+end_src

That's it!
Just three lines to get back a setup worth of config files, efficiency!

** 07/05/2021

Managed to modularize the qtile config files, splitting up the code into separate Managers for each section.
Added [[https://starship.rs][starship.rs]] as my cross-shell prompt, for uniformity in the different shells.
Installed [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shell-color-scripts/][colorscripts]], enabled them on startup for fun, and added Hollow Knight ASCII art to startup_scripts for [[https://github.com/anhsirk0/fetch-master-6000][fm6000]] as well. Might work on it later.

Added Rust replacements for various features related to command line.

-   [[https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty][Alacritty]] :: A blazing fast terminal.
-   [[https://starship.rs][Starship.rs]] :: Cross-shell Prompt.
-   [[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat][Bat]] : Replacement for the =cat= command.
-   [[https://github.com/ogham/exa][Exa]] : Replacement for the =ls= command.
-   [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][Ripgrep]] : Replacement for the =grep= command.
-   [[https://github.com/dalance/procs][Procs]] : Replacement for the =ps= command.

Finally, used the [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_profile][.bash_profile]] file in order to split up the [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/bashrc][.bashrc]] into separate files.
Helps in keeping it clean with a separate files for [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions][functions]] and [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_aliases][aliases]].

I suppose this update arc could be considered to be focused on Modularization and Rust replacements.

** 19/05/2021

I've set up a new homepage for my browser, which is, [[https://qutebrowser.org/][qutebrowser]].
It has been inspired from, and is a condensed down version of the [[https://github.com/b-coimbra/dawn][dawn]] homepage by b-coimbra.
While I did set out making one for myself, I really did like the dawn version, so, it's just a simpler version of it.

The required assets for the homepage are present in the =browser= directory, in the case that you wish to implement them in your browser as well.
Along with that, I've also placed all the packages that I use in the =packages.txt=, still need to sort it out into Pacman specific and AUR specific packages.

**Keep in mind that these commands are DANGEROUS**

Setting up all the required dependencies for my Arch Linux configuration can now be done with a simple shell script, that takes care of the pacman packages.
This record will be updated in the case that I manage to make a version for the =yay= packages as well.

Here's the recovery configuration,

#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:dat-adi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./pac-packages
./install
#+end_src

That should get you to a working system setup without an issue.
If the scripts do not execute, check if you've given it permissions to act as an executable in the first place.
Use =chmod 755 filename= in this case.

I generally note down things in =doom emacs= nowadays however, so, if there's not much of an update with respect to the progress I've made in life, chances are that I've logged some of the progress in there.
Either that, or I'm just really lazy and I haven't done anything great to update the logbook at all.

As of today, I've progressed a bit farther down the glory of the neovim text editor.
What have I gotten myself into?

Neovim + Lua + LSP.
I've heard about lua support and the lsp integration in neovim set ups a while back, like all the back when it first came out.
But, for whatever reason, I wasn't quite able to make the time to check it out.

Now, I have, and it's really cool.
I've installed the [[https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim][Telescope]] plugin, and damn, is it good.
I'm proceeding towards checking out an LSP as well, and most likely, will be going forward with [[https://github.com/microsoft/pyright][pyright]].

However, this is but a simple discovery of profound technology.
The updates to my neovim configuration, should include these changes in the form of documentation (most likely).

**update**: Yup, I ended up changing my theme, and utilizing LSP.
I did find LSP integration really annoying due to the way it displayed the errors.

Switching over to the =palenightfall= theme did wonders to resolving that issue, however.
It still feels a tad bit off, but, I suppose that's just because I'm not used to the way it looks now.

** 20/01/2022

For some odd reason, today, I felt the compulsion to switch my Window Manager to BSPWM, because I really wanted to switch up my workspace after a while.
As such, I went online to, well, =r/unixporn= just to find [[https://github.com/saimoomedits/bspwm-first-rice][Saimoomedit's BSPWM Rice]], and considering that it
looked really clean, I figured that it was time to fix the configuration that I've set up for BSPWM for real.

The amount of stuff I fixed trying to get BSPWM to work however, blows my mind.
Referencing saimoo's rice, I managed to fix a few issues that was really bugging me from the initial days of working with Arch Linux.

- [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Music_Player_Daemon][MPD]] :: I finally managed to fix mpd, simply by getting rid of the template configuration and actually going through the file, discarding what was not required.
- [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Polybar][Polybar]] :: Took in Saimoo's rice, and got it to work! Considering that I don't play too much attention to the windows, I've removed them entirely though.

A few forum answers that helped me out here a bit were,
- [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=120371][Failed to bind the =mpd= service]]
- [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=205408][Can't find any song in mpc]]

My LSP configuration in Neovim seems to have completed broken down, so, that's quite unfortunate, but, that's something to fix for another day perhaps.
Figured that I might as well switch up my wallpaper as well, it's been a while.
