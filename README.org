Note: I've managed to successfully migrate these files into my [[https://heltale.com/posts/dotfiles/][website]] and recommend that you instead go through this README over there. I'll be maintaining that a lot more and it's relatively a lot more readable and cleaner, props to Hugo & Congo.

* What is this repository for?
A simple repository to contain the configuration files of my editors, and settings of the IDEs as well. Maybe a bit more.

Kind of also used as a log of changes made over the years of Linux Distros and Window Manager hopping.

It really only just contains my configurations of my =.vimrc=, and maybe I'll add in my emacs config once I get the hang of it as well.

** 19/04/2021

I've converted to Arch Linux.

I've connected bunch of my files required for my configuration into this repository.
At this point, the config consists of a large number of applications, and software, ranging from fish to vim, to tmux, to qtile, to DOOM Emacs.

I can probably say that it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to get my setup back, on a new computer of Arch Linux, with a simple git pull and configure using symlinks at this point.

** 30/04/2021

Discovered [[https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot*getting-started][dotbot]].
My setup only continues to be easier to set up.

At this point, all I need to do in order to set myself back up, would be a simple few lines.

#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:dat-adi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
#+end_src

That's it!
Just three lines to get back a setup worth of config files, efficiency!

** 07/05/2021

Managed to modularize the qtile config files, splitting up the code into separate Managers for each section.
Added [[https://starship.rs][starship.rs]] as my cross-shell prompt, for uniformity in the different shells.
Installed [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shell-color-scripts/][colorscripts]], enabled them on startup for fun, and added Hollow Knight ASCII art to startup_scripts for [[https://github.com/anhsirk0/fetch-master-6000][fm6000]] as well. Might work on it later.

Added Rust replacements for various features related to command line.

-   [[https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty][Alacritty]] :: A blazing fast terminal.
-   [[https://starship.rs][Starship.rs]] :: Cross-shell Prompt.
-   [[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat][Bat]] : Replacement for the =cat= command.
-   [[https://github.com/ogham/exa][Exa]] : Replacement for the =ls= command.
-   [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][Ripgrep]] : Replacement for the =grep= command.
-   [[https://github.com/dalance/procs][Procs]] : Replacement for the =ps= command.

Finally, used the [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_profile][.bash_profile]] file in order to split up the [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/bashrc][.bashrc]] into separate files.
Helps in keeping it clean with a separate files for [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/.functions][functions]] and [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_aliases][aliases]].

I suppose this update arc could be considered to be focused on Modularization and Rust replacements.

** 19/05/2021

I've set up a new homepage for my browser, which is, [[https://qutebrowser.org/][qutebrowser]].
It has been inspired from, and is a condensed down version of the [[https://github.com/b-coimbra/dawn][dawn]] homepage by b-coimbra.
While I did set out making one for myself, I really did like the dawn version, so, it's just a simpler version of it.

[[./assets/dawn_desktop.png]]

The required assets for the homepage are present in the =browser= directory, in the case that you wish to implement them in your browser as well.
Along with that, I've also placed all the packages that I use in the =packages.txt=, still need to sort it out into Pacman specific and AUR specific packages.

**Keep in mind that these commands are DANGEROUS**

Setting up all the required dependencies for my Arch Linux configuration can now be done with a simple shell script, that takes care of the pacman packages.
This record will be updated in the case that I manage to make a version for the =yay= packages as well.

Here's the recovery configuration,

#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:dat-adi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./pac-packages
./install
#+end_src

That should get you to a working system setup without an issue.
If the scripts do not execute, check if you've given it permissions to act as an executable in the first place.
Use =chmod 755 filename= in this case.

I generally note down things in =doom emacs= nowadays however, so, if there's not much of an update with respect to the progress I've made in life, chances are that I've logged some of the progress in there.
Either that, or I'm just really lazy and I haven't done anything great to update the logbook at all.

As of today, I've progressed a bit farther down the glory of the neovim text editor.
What have I gotten myself into?

Neovim + Lua + LSP.
I've heard about lua support and the lsp integration in neovim set ups a while back, like all the back when it first came out.
But, for whatever reason, I wasn't quite able to make the time to check it out.

Now, I have, and it's really cool.
I've installed the [[https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim][Telescope]] plugin, and damn, is it good.
I'm proceeding towards checking out an LSP as well, and most likely, will be going forward with [[https://github.com/microsoft/pyright][pyright]].

However, this is but a simple discovery of profound technology.
The updates to my neovim configuration, should include these changes in the form of documentation (most likely).

**update**: Yup, I ended up changing my theme, and utilizing LSP.
I did find LSP integration really annoying due to the way it displayed the errors.

Switching over to the =palenightfall= theme did wonders to resolving that issue, however.
It still feels a tad bit off, but, I suppose that's just because I'm not used to the way it looks now.

** 20/01/2022

For some odd reason, today, I felt the compulsion to switch my Window Manager to BSPWM, because I really wanted to switch up my workspace after a while.
As such, I went online to, well, =r/unixporn= just to find [[https://github.com/saimoomedits/bspwm-first-rice][Saimoomedit's BSPWM Rice]], and considering that it
looked really clean, I figured that it was time to fix the configuration that I've set up for BSPWM for real.

The amount of stuff I fixed trying to get BSPWM to work however, blows my mind.
Referencing saimoo's rice, I managed to fix a few issues that was really bugging me from the initial days of working with Arch Linux.

- [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Music_Player_Daemon][MPD]] :: I finally managed to fix mpd, simply by getting rid of the template configuration and actually going through the file, discarding what was not required.
- [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Polybar][Polybar]] :: Took in Saimoo's rice, and got it to work! Considering that I don't play too much attention to the windows, I've removed them entirely though.

A few forum answers that helped me out here a bit were,
- [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=120371][Failed to bind the =mpd= service]]
- [[https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=205408][Can't find any song in mpc]]

My LSP configuration in Neovim seems to have completed broken down, so, that's quite unfortunate, but, that's something to fix for another day perhaps.
Figured that I might as well switch up my wallpaper as well, it's been a while.

I recall that I mentioned "something to fix for another day" in order to fix my Neovim configuration. Well, apparently that day was today.
However, even that is slightly inaccurate considering that I spent two days on it. Did I fix it? Well yes, but no.

I've kinda fixed it, I still don't know how to optimally set up my configuration yet.
You mention question as to why I say that, and most of the reason is because I decided, on a whim, that it was time for lua.

I spent about two days converting my setup into lua.
The first morning was all about messing up, with my configuration not making any sense to me, mind you this was still in vimscript at this stage, with the LSP additions at the bottom that made zero sense to day-1 me. The first afternoon was about converting parts of my configuration into lua, and trying to make sense of everything that was happening. Now, this was promising and the world seemed to finally make sense, it was time for a full conversion. Proceeding forward, the first evening was about despair and regret, for with the full conversion of my configuration, stuff that made sense to me in the start seemed to make no sense at all.

Why weren't packages recognized? Why was lua starting to consume itself in self hatred with that hideous indentation? Why did the statue of equality have three entrances for the classes of society despite literally being about equality? Nothing made sense at this stage, and it was an indiction to give in to some rest, and so, that's what I did.

The second morning was quite a bit better, with me finally figuring that you could divide up everything into smaller sections and just [[https://github.com/dat-adi/dotfiles/blob/master/config/nvim/init.lua][modularize the configuration]] instead of looking at a block of code in hatred.
Stuff makes a lot more sense at this stage and I completely abstracted away the need to look at redundant pieces of configuration such as the plugins and keybinds by filing them into the =lua/base= directory. Debugging is where stuff got a slightly bit more interesting.

As it turns out, lua doesn't play very nicely with plugins quite yet, even more so when you use =vim-plug=, however, I'm a bit too scarred to test out something new, and so I've tried to fix the problem within the parameters.
So, by extracting the installed plugins' lua directory into the root lua directory, things started making sense since the configuration files could access the lua plugins directory now.
I'm actually pretty sure that the issue lies with the plugin configuration setup and nothing else honestly, but, maybe that. Is for another day.

** 04/04/2022

I've got a new laptop!
This also means that I will be required to port my Linux system over to another laptop.
Initially, I was a bit uneasy considering that I've heard a lot of people mention that dual booting would be a pain with Windows 11, but so far I haven't faced any issues other than struggling with installing Arch and disk partition management.

The only extra step that I need to take is to enable secure boot before I log on to Windows if I want to play valorant, because that's apparently a requirement now.

Anyway, a friend of mine recommended Sway, Wayland, and I decided to give it a shot. Verdict? It is smooth as butter. I love the clean interface that it provides, and am still using the default waybar.

Configuration for sway was surprisingly extremely easy, and most of the issues that I've faced are actually more due to applications not being able to support wayland. Ahem, emacs, ahem.

Anyway, workarounds were [[https://www.fosskers.ca/en/blog/wayland][found]] and the system is very clean.
While the new laptop definitely contributed towards some of the charm, Sway was a good decision to make.

Not too much to report, but here's a view of the rice.
